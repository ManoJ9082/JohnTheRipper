# JohnTheRipper

## Objective

"To evaluate and strengthen password security by using John the Ripper to audit password strength across our systems. This tool will help identify weak, default, or compromised passwords (e.g., in user accounts, databases, or encrypted files) through controlled brute-force, dictionary, and rule-based attacks. Findings will guide actionable recommendations to enforce stronger password policies, reduce vulnerabilities, and align with cybersecurity best practices."

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to crack passwords using brute-force, dictionary, and smart rule-based attacks.  
- Got hands-on with different hash types (like MD5, SHA-256) and how to extract/convert them for testing.  
- Got comfortable with the command line for running security tools and automating tasks.  
- Discovered why strong password policies matter by spotting weak passwords (like "123456" or "password").  
- Figured out how to troubleshoot issues (like unsupported hashes) and speed up large password-cracking jobs.  
- Practiced reporting security risks and suggesting fixes, like enabling multi-factor authentication.  
- Stayed ethical by learning to test passwords responsibly, *only* with permission.  

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
